# Type 2 Diabetes Detection Backend

This repository contains the backend for a Type 2 diabetes detection system. It provides an API for detecting diabetes based on input features, built using FastAPI.

---

## Features
- Easy-to-use RESTful API.
- Powered by machine learning to detect Type 2 diabetes.
- Lightweight and fast, built with FastAPI.

---

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package manager)

---

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/type2diabetes-detection-backend.git
   cd type2diabetes-detection-backend

2.	Install the dependencies:
	```bash
	pip install -r requirements.txt

Running the API

To start the API server, run the following command:
```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```
The API will be available at: http://127.0.0.1:8000
	•	The --reload option allows for hot-reloading during development.

Usage
	•	Use a tool like Postman, cURL, or any HTTP client to interact with the API.
	•	Example endpoint: /predict (replace with your actual endpoint if different).
